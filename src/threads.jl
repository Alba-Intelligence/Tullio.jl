    divide(apply!, Z, (A,B), (1:5,1:6), (1:7), 10^3)

Calling `apply!(Z, A,B,C, 1:5,1:6, 1:7)` should do the work.
But if there are enough elements, this will call `apply!` many times
in different threads.

Ideally it would do some smart recursive blocking thing.
The first list of indices are safe to partition among threads,
if those in the second list get divided they need to accumulate results.

For now it just divides up the first index among threads.

The case of complete reduction assumes that `Z` is a 0-dim array.
